### Overview

This repository contains a Python-based Traffic Monitoring System that leverages the Google Maps API to monitor and log traffic conditions between a specified origin and destination. The system provides real-time traffic updates, logs dangerous driving conditions, and visualizes traffic data over time. The system is designed to run continuously, with checks performed at regular intervals.

---

### Features

- **Real-time Traffic Monitoring**: Continuously checks and logs traffic conditions between specified locations.
- **Speed Simulation**: Randomly generates driving speeds to simulate different scenarios.
- **Danger Alerts**: Logs and triggers audible alerts when hazardous conditions are detected.
- **Data Logging**: Saves traffic data to a CSV file for further analysis.
- **Visualization**: Plots traffic conditions using bar charts with color-coded traffic delays.
- **Audible Alerts**: Plays a sound alert when dangerous conditions are detected.

---

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-monitoring-system.git
   cd traffic-monitoring-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Google Maps API Key**:
   Obtain a Google Maps API key and set it as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

---

### Usage

To start monitoring traffic, run the script:
```bash
python traffic_monitor.py
```
The script will continuously check traffic conditions every 5 minutes and log the results.

---

### Configuration

- **API Key**: Ensure your Google Maps API key is set as an environment variable (`GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`).
- **Origin and Destination**: Edit the `origin` and `destination` variables in `traffic_monitor.py` with your desired coordinates:
  ```python
  origin = "52.57043146808288,13.520488110623809"
  destination = "52.522072764462955,13.41329526829186"
  ```
- **Sound Alert**: Place an `alert.mp3` file in the project directory for sound alerts when dangerous conditions are detected.

---

### Output

1. **CSV Logging**: Traffic data is logged in `gps_traffic_data.csv`, including:
   - Coordinates of origin and destination
   - Traffic status, distance, and duration
   - Duration in traffic and simulated speed
   - Danger status

2. **Visualizations**: The script generates bar plots to visualize traffic conditions at various waypoints along the route. The bars are color-coded:
   - **Green**: Delay less than 5 minutes
   - **Yellow**: Delay between 5-15 minutes
   - **Red**: Delay greater than 15 minutes
   - **Black**: Danger (high speed in heavy traffic)

---

### Customization

- **Speed Range**: Modify the `generate_random_speed()` function in `traffic_monitor.py` to change the range of simulated speeds.
- **Check Interval**: Adjust the `time.sleep(300)` interval in the main loop to change how frequently traffic conditions are checked.

---

### Logging

The system uses Pythonâ€™s `logging` module to record:
- Routine traffic checks
- Dangerous conditions, with timestamps for easy tracking.
